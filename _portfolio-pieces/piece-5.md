description: "3D Rendered Watch Case Study"
details: "I created a 3D rendering of a wristwatch using Cinema4D and Adobe Illustrator. images for use in product promotion, with a focus on accurate 3D modeling of a watch.I did not want to produce a photo-realistic rendering of a watch. Instead, I wanted to create a realistic illustrative model: stylized but retaining the sense that it could exist in a physical space. The watch was created mostly using Cinema 4D, and photographed within Cinema 4D."
