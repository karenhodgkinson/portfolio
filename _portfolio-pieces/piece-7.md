title: "Cycling Pathway Case Study"
description: "Design Research Case Study"
details: "A team consisting of myself and 3 fellow designers were tasked with reviewing existing cycling pathway infrastructure and proposing effective solutions to the design flaws we discovered. Together we conducted research and created a survey that we used to reach out to the citizens of Ottawa to gain insight into the current issues with Multi-Use Pathways. We designed solutions in the form of new signage and pavement markings. I have included here only the signage and pavement markings that I designed and created myself, as well as my own mockups that show the markings and signage in use. All images were created using Adobe Illustrator."
