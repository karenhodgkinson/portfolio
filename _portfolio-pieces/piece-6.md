title: "Razor Package Design"
description: "Environmentally friendly Packaging Design"
details: "Razor packaging tends to be quite wasteful, with multiple plastic layers that cannot be completely recycled. I designed a more environmentally-friendly alternative package that can be fully recycled, as well as being created using mostly recycled materials. I created the concept, produced die line diagrams and mockups in Adobe Illustrator, and constructed a prototype using recycled card paper."
