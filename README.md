# Interactive wireframes

## Overview

Code the interactive wireframes for your portfolio website. *Consider every unique component of the website.*

Some details & things about the website to consider:

- It should be completely responsive between 320px – ~2500px.
- Include any typefaces you’re planning on using.
- Only placeholder images are necessary, but they should be representative of what will be included (sketches, roughs, finals, etc.)
- Use grid systems, type systems & default module CSS.
- All (all!) the text must be real—no placeholders.
- **ABSOLUTELY NO JAVASCRIPT!!**—your site should be fully functional without it, we’ll add it in later.
- The homepage should be complete.
- An example of a portfolio piece page should be complete.
- And any other unique pages: about, contact, etc. should also be complete.

### Get critiques & grade yourself

To receive a grade on the interactive wireframes you’ll need to get critiques from peers, write a personal performance rationale, fill out the rubric & get critiqued by the teacher.

- [ ] **3 peer critiques**
  Select 3 of your peers and get them to [critique your project ➔](/courses/shared/peer-evaluation/)
  Also consider performing [usability tests ➔](topics/usability-testing-checklist/)
- [ ] **Fill out the rubric**
  Using the rubric above, copy the code to a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, and select the appropriate grade for each section. Sum the values of the rubric.
- [ ] **Personal performance rationale**
  As a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, write a short-ish rationale explaining how well you did completing your interactive wireframes:
  - What did you do well?
  - What did you do poorly?
  - What could be improved?
  - What was amazing?
  - Does the website communicate the right message?
  - Is the website usable?
- [ ] **Teacher critique**
  Meet with the teacher in class and get a critique of your project.
- [ ] **Determine a grade**
  Using all the above information, assign yourself a grade that reflects everything you’ve completed.
  Discuss this grade with the teacher—if it’s fair & honest the teacher will assign the grade immediately.
